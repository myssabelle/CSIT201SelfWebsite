                        Hey! I’m Mary Yssabelle Hermosa, a second year Computer Science student at Cebu Institute of Technology
                        - University. I dabble in web design, and I do graphics occasionally for organization-related work.
                        Quarantine has given me way too much time, so here I am. My hobbies include writing, filmography and
                        directing, piano and watching too many shows on netflix. Nice to meet you!
                    </p>

                <div class="firstbox">
                    <h2 class="firsthead">Little Bits of Me</h2>
                    <p class=firsttext>My main belief in life is that you are never just one thing. Who I am today is a result
                        of millions of decisions made by me and for me, and a stereotype or a simple word cannot possibly
                        contain the complexities of a human being. I am a Computer Science student, yes, that is true. But
                        growing up, I loved theater, music, photography, and many other things that aren’t totally inline
                        with my career choice. Right now, I’m in different organizations that are totally different at their
                        cores. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.<br><br>
                        I am 20. And for the past two decades, I wouldn’t, and I couldn’t possibly say that I have done much
                        of anything worth mentioning. Much like everyone, I spent most of my life in school. And because I liked
                        to join as many activities as I could, I was in school a lot more than an average kid. And although I’ve
                        learned a lot of things, and skills during these times, I also missed out on a lot of other things. When
                        my cousins were going out to go to the beach, I was in my room pretending to study. When my friends played
                        hooky, I was probably working on some extracurricular. My family is full of workaholics, and I mirrored
                        that growing up. I wasn’t a perfect kid by any means, but most of my life has been dedicated into academics.
                        Now, I still have those traits at my core, but I’ve decided to live a little. I buy that dress I’ve been
                        wanting for a while. I treat myself whenever I’m getting burned out. I go to parties and events with my
                        friends. Get that night of sleep when I know I need it. I laugh a little, and live a little.
