                        Hey! I’m Mary Yssabelle Hermosa, a second year Computer Science student at Cebu Institute of Technology
                        - University. I dabble in web design, and I do graphics occasionally for organization-related work.
                        Quarantine has given me way too much time, so here I am. My hobbies include writing, filmography and
                        directing, piano and watching too many shows on netflix. Nice to meet you!
                    </p>
                </div>
                <div class="firstbox">
                    <h2 class="firsthead">Little Bits of Me</h2>
                    <p class=firsttext>My main belief in life is that you are never just one thing. Who I am today is a result
                        of millions of decisions made by me and for me, and a stereotype or a simple word cannot possibly
                        contain the complexities of a human being. I am a Computer Science student, yes, that is true. But
                        growing up, I loved theater, music, photography, and many other things that aren’t totally inline
                        with my career choice. Right now, I’m in different organizations that are totally different at their
                        cores. And I wouldn’t have it any other way.<br><br>
                        I am 20. And for the past two decades, I wouldn’t, and I couldn’t possibly say that I have done much
                        of anything worth mentioning. Much like everyone, I spent most of my life in school. And because I liked
                        to join as many activities as I could, I was in school a lot more than an average kid. And although I’ve
                        learned a lot of things, and skills during these times, I also missed out on a lot of other things. When
                        my cousins were going out to go to the beach, I was in my room pretending to study. When my friends played
                        hooky, I was probably working on some extracurricular. My family is full of workaholics, and I mirrored
                        that growing up. I wasn’t a perfect kid by any means, but most of my life has been dedicated into academics.
                        Now, I still have those traits at my core, but I’ve decided to live a little. I buy that dress I’ve been
                        wanting for a while. I treat myself whenever I’m getting burned out. I go to parties and events with my
                        friends. Get that night of sleep when I know I need it. I laugh a little, and live a little.

                <div class="secondbox">
                    <h2 class="secondhead">My Second Homes</h2>
                    <p class=secondtext>I’ve been to a total of five different schools. My preschool was at Sacred Heart, a very
                        small tight-knit Catholic school with a huge playground. (Huge for tiny little-me, but tiny for adult-me)
                        I remember very little of my time there, with my highlights being: (1) a boy I had a crush on named Oscar
                        (can’t remember his face), and (2) being pushed to the ground on my ‘graduation’, and busted my chin open,
                        leaving a huge scar. Fun times. Then I moved into a slightly bigger tight-knit school, only this time it was
                        a Protestant school. (MLBCS - Matilda L. Bradford Christian School) I have more memories here than my previous
                        school, but it feels very distant. I moved before I could graduate with my batch, so I wasn’t really part of the
                        ‘nostalgia’ most of my batch feels when they think about Bradford. In 6th grade, I move to a big school, USC.
                        It’s not at all how it’s portrayed. I think within the walls of the schools, kids are wild, dishonest and
                        rambunctious. I stayed there for 5 years, all throughout high school. I knew a lot of people, but my friend group
                        was pretty small. A lot of family and personal issues later, I moved to a small school for senior high - STI. 2
                        years there felt like 10. There was only one section and it felt like everyday had all these moments and memories
                        that I still remember and love. There was a lot of drama, but I think I learned the most in those two years, that
                        in the previous 10. A lot of it was probably thanks to this teacher who never stopped believing in me, despite my
                        darkest hours. I represented the school in competitions nationwide in both years, and did well for a ‘senior high
                        school’ student competing with college juniors and seniors.<br>
                        <br>Today, I am at CIT University, and it has been a whirlwind. I think the past year has been extremely
                        high and low that I cannot begin to tell the story. Maybe after a few years, when my story here ends,
                        I can.

                <div class="thirdbox">
                    <h2 class="thirdhead">Jack of all Trades</h2>
                    <p class=thirdtext>As you might have figured from above, I usually try to give 100% to anything I commit
                        myself to. Over the years, with the hundreds of projects and presentations I worked on, I picked up a
                        few things. I learned to film, and edit videos. I learned to write scripts, presentations and essays.
                        (I reached nationals in an essay competition too.) I learned to design and code. And I think I am pretty
                        good at most of these things. I picked up all of these skills because of necessity. I wanted anything that
                        had my name on it to reach high standards, thus needing these skills. (Not gonna lie, they were times where
                        I just felt defeated and just gave up because I couldn’t do it. Situations like these usually end up with me 
                        depressed over a low grade lmao) The point is, I never took on these skills as a hobby, or as an interest.
                        Therefore, I never really invested much time other than what it took to finish a project. So I’m not great
                        at it. I don’t think I’m great at anything at all. Thus, I am a ‘Jack’. I am no king or queen, I am not the
                        best or the greatest at anything or everything. I simply am a ‘Jack’, walking down whatever path I find myself
                        on, picking up the skills along the way. If you'd like to see a few of my works, you can contact me in the Contact Us page.<br>
                        <br>Now because of my workaholic nature, I usually never had any time to invest into my interests or
                        hobbies. If I did have the time, I was probably too exhausted to try. This is one of my biggest regrets
                        in life. A lot of the people I know found a hobby or two that they liked, by the time they reached high
                        school. Some found it earlier on, while I’m here being a ‘Jack’. A few things that I like doing is playing
                        the piano, reading a good book, design clothes, and playing with makeup. Totally out of character of a
                        typical ‘programmer’. I also like to play tabletop games, but it’s hard to find people to play with so I
                        don’t do it often. A lot of my hobbies are something I do to pass the time, or to chill. None of them are
                        particularly fueled by passion, so I’m not really good at it either.<br>
                        <br>I guess that’s it? I figure there is so much more to tell, but even I don’t know all of the
                        complexities of my personality. Well, there’s the rest of the decade to figure it out.
